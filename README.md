# air_traffic_passenger_clustering
# Application of clustering models on air traffic passengers data

In this project we will built all machine learning models for **clustering** (shown below) using **scikit-learn**.
Our training data set contains numerical and categorical data from different operating_airlines, the to cluster them in meaningful clusters.

In this lesson you will learn about...

- **Task 1: [Importing libraries, Data Loading and Initial Exploration](#ld)**

- **Task 2: [Data cleaning](#dc)**
    - Identifying Missing Data
    - Dealing with Missing Data
    
- **Task 3: [Exploratory data analysis](#eda)**

- **Task 4: [K means clustering with elbow method](#k)**

- **Task 5: [Hierarchial clustering with dendogram](#h)**

- **Task 6: [DB scan](#d)**

#### NOTE:
This tutorial assumes that you are already know the basics of coding in **Python** and are familiar with the theory behind **K means clustering**, **Hierarchial clustering** and **DB scan** models.
Also you should be aware about **The elbow method**, **dendogram** and **K-distance graph**.
